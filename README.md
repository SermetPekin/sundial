# The Sundial Problem from a New Angle

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/russellgoyder/sundial/HEAD?labpath=sundial.ipynb)

This [notebook](https://github.com/russellgoyder/sundial/blob/main/sundial.ipynb) accompanies my [sundial paper](https://russellgoyder.github.io/sundial-latex/). I originally used [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) for the calculations, but decided to reproduce them here to make the analysis more accessible, and as away to learn [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and [GAlgebra](https://github.com/pygae/galgebra). I used my [cheat sheet](https://russellgoyder.github.io/geometric-algebra-cheat-sheet/) for Geometric Algebra at various points.

I haven't reproduced the orbit analysis, equation of time or plots of the shadow tip yet, but plan to add them in the future. For now, however, all the main results are reproduced in [sundial.ipynb](https://github.com/russellgoyder/sundial/blob/main/sundial.ipynb).
